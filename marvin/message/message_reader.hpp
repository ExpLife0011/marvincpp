/**
 * Instances of this class represent an incoming http(s) response message from a socket/stream.
 * Please note the "incoming" because the MessageReader is seeking to provide a dynamic interface
 * so that other components can start interacting with the reader (and the message) once the headers
 * have arrived and POSSIBLY before the body has arrived.
 *
 * In addition there is an effort to provide a "streaming" interface to the body data so that if the message
 * is being passed on that pass-on can start before all the body has arrived. This is an effort to reduce latency
 * and reduce the size of the buffering that is required.
 *
 * @TODO - trying to workout how to manage the body
 * @TODO - want the response to message to BE this class so what to base
 * ResponseREader on MessageBase
 *
 * Buffer strategy
 * ===============
 *
 * The MessageReader object calls on a Connection object to do the reading from the underlying socket/stream.
 * The MessageReader provides buffers to the Connection class at the time the read is initiated
 * and receives an error code and bytes_transfered back from the Connection via the read handler.
 * This is pretty much standard Boost::asio behaviour
 *
 * Internally the MessageReader has a buffer that is used for reading the initial part of the message
 * that contains the message headers. From these buffers the MessageReaders fills in the various header
 * and first line fields and never has to pass that buffer up to the "user" components.
 *
 * Body data is buffered differently, there are two reasons for this:
 *  -   to promote an easy "streaming" style interface body buffers allocated by the ResponseREader 
 *      and are passed off to the caller
 *      and then become the callers responsibility. This allows the MessageReader to make decisions about
 *      the size of these buffers and to do a degree of "flowing" - to use a nodejs term.
 *
 *  -   secondly the body data is DE_CHUNKED. Which means that a block of incoming data that may be contiguous
 *      when read has holes in it after DE-CHUNKING process(the chunk headers need to be ignored). To avoid copying
 *      the chunk bodies into a contiguous buffer a concept of a Fragmented buffer has been introduced. This is
 *      what the MessageReader passes up to the caller via the read callback functions.
 *
